# Dense Graphs
Graphs with many edges (edge ratio > 50% of maximum possible edges).
These graphs tend to have fewer articulation points and larger biconnected components.

Format: Each file contains:
- Line 1: # Description
- Line 2: num_vertices num_edges
- Following lines: u v (edge from u to v)

Vertices are 0-indexed.
