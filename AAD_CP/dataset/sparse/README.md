# Sparse Graphs
Graphs with relatively few edges compared to vertices (edge ratio ~1.5-2.5x vertices).
These graphs are likely to have many articulation points and bridges.

Format: Each file contains:
- Line 1: # Description
- Line 2: num_vertices num_edges
- Following lines: u v (edge from u to v)

Vertices are 0-indexed.
